# EnDeGen: Encoder-Decoder Text Generation with RNNs

EnDeGen is a project that focuses on generating text using the Encoder-Decoder architecture with Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs). It leverages the power of deep learning to predict and generate text sequences based on given input data.

## Overview

EnDeGen is designed to generate text by learning patterns from a given dataset and predicting the next characters or words in a sequence. It utilizes the Encoder-Decoder model, which consists of two components:

* **Encoder**: The Encoder takes the input sequence and processes it to capture the meaningful representation or context of the input. In this project, we use an RNN-based Encoder to encode the input sequence.

* **Decoder**: The Decoder takes the output of the Encoder and generates the target sequence, character by character or word by word. The Decoder also uses an RNN-based architecture, trained to predict the next character or word based on the context received from the Encoder.
