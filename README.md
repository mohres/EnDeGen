# EnDeGen: Encoder-Decoder Text Generation with RNNs

EnDeGen is a project that focuses on generating text using the Encoder-Decoder architecture with Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs). It leverages the power of deep learning to predict and generate text sequences based on given input data.

## Overview

EnDeGen is designed to generate text by learning patterns from a given dataset and predicting the next characters or words in a sequence. It utilizes the Encoder-Decoder model, which consists of two components:

* **Encoder**: The Encoder takes the input sequence and processes it to capture the meaningful representation or context of the input. In this project, we use an RNN-based Encoder to encode the input sequence.

* **Decoder**: The Decoder takes the output of the Encoder and generates the target sequence, character by character or word by word. The Decoder also uses an RNN-based architecture, trained to predict the next character or word based on the context received from the Encoder.


## Example Result 
**[After training for 30 epochs, the model was able to generate the following text]**

All: How nigh should do boys where no harm to keep
Than younger conference was a point of your
Boint powers. What, will our princely father York?
Upon my love, think'st thou that I am little
That go to chastity of our intone humour
will church the mighty look od all in 

Bolingbroke:
Be it so I have the let morn of your
having breath? Of high and lowly me!
So, fellow, get me heaven, out o'er at Sicilia
much in placent, all the prisoner to do fight:
I do remember this be this: he's very little
That wound this way how touch'd Slones, where you
will have consumenes to yourself. You talk-worng, would wed both
He thinks me down to such a party instinct,
Travelling to practise himself be in love:
I'll blush your honour.

ISABELLA:
Which is too careless it and me?
My grave be loss, that you hither hath a hand,
And shows good words will maid to see thee dead,
How doth the queen of Naples him.
But let it serve to take our foes.

ANTONIO:
I beseech your parish close by Caling home,
That his bold hand.
